However, when it comes to data in Python, you are most likely going to come across [**Python dictionaries**](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) and [**Pandas DataFrames**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), especially if you’re reading in data from a file or external data source.\n",
